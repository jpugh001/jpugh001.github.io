Using logical operators `and` and `or` in programming, particularly within a `while` loop.  Simple guide that covers the basics of `and` and `or`, along with examples in a `while` loop context:

### Logical Operators: `and` & `or`

#### 1. **Understanding `and` and `or`**
   - **`and` Operator**: Returns `True` if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - **`or` Operator**: Returns `True` if at least one of the operands is true; if both are false, it returns `False`.

#### 2. **Examples**
   - **`and` Example**: `True and False` → `False`
   - **`or` Example**: `True or False` → `True`

### Using `and` and `or` in a `while` Loop

A `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is `True`. Integrating `and` and `or` in the loop's condition can control its execution more precisely based on multiple criteria.


### Pseudocode for `and` and `or` in `while` Loops

#### Example 1: Using `and`
```plaintext
Initialize number to 0
WHILE (number is less than 10 AND number is even)
    Print "Current number is ", number
    Increment number by 2
END WHILE
```

#### Example 2: Using `or`
```plaintext
Initialize number to 0
WHILE (number is less than 10 OR number is exactly 12)
    Print "Current number is ", number
    IF number equals 12
        Break the loop
    END IF
    Increment number by 1
END WHILE
```

### Tips for Using `and` and `or` in Loops
1. **Clarity**: Keep the conditions clear and simple. Complicated logical expressions can make your code hard to read and debug.
2. **Efficiency**: Remember that `and` stops evaluating if the first condition is `False` (since the overall result cannot be `True` anymore), and `or` stops evaluating if the first condition is `True` (since at least one true condition is sufficient for `True`). This behavior is known as "short-circuit evaluation".
