# About Me
## My interests
* I like to spend time outdoors (whether it's hiking or camping), cook, and read. Another hobby of mine is art. I've been doing art pretty much all my life and I once illustrated a childrens book that was published by the Virginia Museum of Natural History. I really enjoy the chance to be creative.
* I have a B.S. in Psychology and now I'm planning to go back to school for a degree in Statistics. Ultimately, I'm pursuing a career in research data management. So far my favorite classes have been Organic Chemistry, Social Psychology, Research Methods (which I've TA'd for), and Creative Witing. 
* The most fun thing I think I've ever done was go skydiving and I hope I get to go again someday!
* I have a cat named Sunshine :)
## Websites I recomend
* [Screengrab](https://film-grab.com)
  * It's a good way to find a new movie to watch when you otherwise can't decide on something.
  * Browse stills from wide selection of movies or get a still from a random movie.
    * For example, here's a screen grab from the movie _Source Code_ (2011)
    <img src="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/52%20(910).jpg?bwg=1547407044" alt="Here's a screengrab from the movie **Source Code**" width=50% height=50%>
* [Food Guesser](https://www.foodguessr.com/)
  * It's like geoguesser, but for food. It's a game where you guess what country a particular dish is from. 
* [Album of the Year](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/)
  * Aggregates both critical and user review for albums. 
  * Aoty is a good resource for discovering new music. You can keep up-to-date with new releases or search for albums by year/decade/genre/etc.

# Simple Python Program to Greet and Predict Age in 5 Years

# Ask for the user's name and age
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the age in 5 years
age_in_5_years = age + 5

# Print a personalized greeting
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"In 5 years, you will be {age_in_5_years} years old.")
