# Simple Python Program to Greet and Predict Age in 5 Years

# Ask for the user's name and age
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the age in 5 years
age_in_5_years = age + 5

# Print a personalized greeting
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"In 5 years, you will be {age_in_5_years} years old.")
