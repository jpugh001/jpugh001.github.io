1) How do the three languages declare and assign variables? Do they require specific data type declaration?
*Python represents declares a variable with as variable name = data type(data origin/location) 
*Javascript declares a variable with the var command. It then assigns value to the declared variable.
*Similar to Javascript, C++ declares a variable by stating data type = variable name and assigns value through simple commands.
2) How do the languages represent conditional statements? What syntax variations do you notice?
*Python uses a "while" command and "if" and "else" commands. The output value is presented with a print("output") command
*Javascript uses if and else statements nested in the while statement 
*C++ presents formats the while command similarly to flowgorithm, except the and value is represented by &&.  
3) How do the languages structure loops, particularly the while loop used in your guessing game?
*Python prompts the user to input a number, which is again run throught the 'while' sequence. 
*After the if and else statements, the program prompts another gueaa within the while statement.
*Prompts another guess with the cin >> function.
4) How do each of these languages handle output to the console?
*Python uses the print command to display output.
*Javascript uses the window.alert command to display output.
*C++ handles output by the cout << "output" << end1, sometimes on its own sometimes within other functions. 
5) What differences do you notice in the general syntax and structure of the three languages?
Python and Javascript have much more concise structures than C++. Python in particular assigns and declares a variable with the same command and does not repeat commands which Javascript and C++ both do. All othem have a similar phrasing convention for operaters etc.
